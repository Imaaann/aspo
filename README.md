# ASPO

## A Static code analyzer for java projects

Aspo is a tool that can be used to analyse diffrent **metrics** that relate the **object oriented** paradigm, it can also visualize the relationship of classes, methods, and attributes in your project for greater insights. Aspo is made in hopes of helping developers find problematic classes or classes that don't/misuse object oriented principles.

## How to use Aspo

There 2 main ways to use aspo with your project

### As a CLI tool

you can locally check the OO metrics of your project and identify the outliers by navigating to your project's repository and writing

```
aspo .
```

This will generate 2 files in the `./aspo` repository, mainly a .csv file that has the metric data and a .json file that can be used later with the web-app

- if you don't want any file outputs you can use the -n (--none) flag.
- if you want more experimental metrics you can use the -m (--more) flag.

you can also locally check github projects by pasting a URL instead of a PATH, note that this will take more time as it does download the files locally then deletes them.

### As a web app

You can measure & visualize your projects by visiting [our website](https://example.com/).

Inside this web app you can drop the .json file generated by aspo to checkout the relation ships between your entites (packages, classes, methods, attributes) in a graphical manner.

You can also paste in a link to a github repository and get the same results.
