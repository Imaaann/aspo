**Dockerizing a Spring Boot Application with ASPO CLI**

This document outlines the process of creating a Docker container for a Spring Boot application, installing the ASPO CLI inside the container, containerizing a project from a provided URL, and executing ASPO CLI commands from Java logic within the container, without including any code.
Overview
The goal is to set up a Docker container that hosts a Spring Boot application, integrates a command-line tool called ASPO CLI, incorporates a project from a specified URL, and allows the application to run ASPO CLI commands programmatically.
Prerequisites

Docker must be installed on the host machine.
A Spring Boot project should be available at a publicly accessible Git repository URL.
Familiarity with Docker and Spring Boot concepts is helpful.
Information about how to install the ASPO CLI (e.g., via a downloadable file or package manager) is required.

*Step 1*: Prepare the Docker Environment
Create a configuration file for Docker to define the container setup. This file should:

Start with a base environment that supports Java, suitable for running Spring Boot applications.
Install necessary tools, such as utilities for downloading files and cloning repositories.
Download and set up the ASPO CLI, assuming it’s available from a specific web address or package repository.
Clone the Spring Boot project from the provided repository URL.
Build the Spring Boot project to generate an executable application file.
Configure the container to expose the default port used by Spring Boot applications.
Specify that the container should run the Spring Boot application when started.

*Step 2*: Build and Launch the Container
To create and start the container:

Save the Docker configuration file in the project directory.
Use a Docker command to build the container image, specifying the project URL as a parameter to ensure the correct project is cloned.
Run the container with a command that maps the container’s port to a port on the host machine, allowing access to the Spring Boot application via a web browser or API client.

*Step 3*: Execute ASPO CLI Commands Programmatically
Within the Spring Boot application, include logic to run ASPO CLI commands. This involves:

Creating a component in the application to handle command execution, using a mechanism to invoke system commands and capture their output.
Setting up an endpoint in the application that accepts a command as input, passes it to the command execution component, and returns the result to the caller.
Ensuring the command execution is secure by limiting the types of commands that can be run, to prevent unauthorized actions.
